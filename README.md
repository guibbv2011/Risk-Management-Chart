# risk_managment

This project was created for traders who need to monitor their balance with an account risk calculation. All the user has to do is enter their maximum drowdown, e.g. -1500, their loss percentage per trade, e.g. 5, and voila, the system will show the amount you can lose per trade and will still be waiting for the trades to be entered.
