## 🌐 Cross-Platform Storage

### Web Browsers
- **Storage**: IndexedDB (persistent across browser sessions)
- **Capacity**: Large storage space (much bigger than localStorage)
- **Persistence**: Survives browser restarts, updates, and crashes

### Mobile & Desktop
- **Storage**: SQLite (native database on device)
- **Performance**: Fast, efficient local database
- **Reliability**: Battle-tested database technology

## 🛡️ Data Safety Features

### Automatic Protection
- **Immediate Save**: No risk of losing recent work
- **Cross-Session**: Data survives app crashes
- **Backup Copies**: Automatic backups created
- **Error Recovery**: Built-in data recovery systems

### Verification System
- Every save operation is verified
- Data integrity checks on load
- Automatic healing of corrupted data
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting

## 👤 User Experience

### What Users Notice
- ✅ No "Save" buttons needed
- ✅ Work resumes exactly where left off
- ✅ Same experience on all devices/platforms
- ✅ No configuration or setup required

### What Users DON'T Notice
- Complex storage operations happening automatically
- Platform differences (web vs mobile vs desktop)
- Data validation and error handling
- Backup creation and recovery systems

## 🔧 For Developers

### Key Implementation Points

1. **Every Input Method Saves**
```dart
// Pattern used throughout the app
await performOperation();  // Update data
await _saveRiskSettings(); // Save to storage
await _refreshData();      // Update UI
```

2. **Storage Factory Auto-Detection**
```dart
// Automatically chooses correct storage
final storage = StorageFactory.createTradeStorage();
// Web: IndexedDB, Native: SQLite
```

3. **Verification Built-In**
```dart
// Every save is verified
await _configStorage.saveRiskSettings(settings);
final saved = await _configStorage.loadRiskSettings();
// Confirms data was actually saved
```

## 📊 Storage Details

### Database Schema
```
Trades Store:
- id (auto-increment)
- result (profit/loss amount)
- timestamp (ISO 8601 string)
- created_at (creation timestamp)
- updated_at (modification timestamp)

Indexes:
- timestamp (for date range queries)
- result (for profit/loss filtering)
```

### Settings Storage
```
Risk Settings:
- accountBalance
- currentBalance
- maxDrawdown
- lossPerTradePercentage
- isDynamicMaxDrawdown
```

## 🚀 Performance Features

### Optimizations
- **Indexed Queries**: Fast data retrieval
- **Smart Caching**: Reduces unnecessary database calls
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient bulk operations
- **Lazy Loading**: Data loaded only when needed

### Memory Management
- Automatic cache cleanup
- Proper resource disposal
- Minimal memory footprint
- No memory leaks

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### If Data Seems Missing
1. Check browser developer console for error messages
2. Verify app has storage permissions
3. Check if in private/incognito browsing mode
4. Clear browser cache and restart app

### For Web Users
- **Private Browsing**: May not persist data
- **Storage Quota**: Browser may have storage limits
- **Third-Party Cookies**: Ensure enabled for the site

### For Mobile Users
- **Storage Permissions**: App needs file storage access
- **Device Storage**: Ensure sufficient free space
- **App Updates**: Data persists through app updates
