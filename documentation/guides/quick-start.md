## Tips for Success

### üéØ Risk Management Best Practices

1. **Start Conservative**
   - Begin with 1-2% loss per trade
   - Use fixed drawdown mode initially
   - Gradually increase as you gain confidence

2. **Respect the Limits**
   - Never override risk warnings
   - If trade exceeds limit, reduce position size
   - Trust the mathematical safeguards

3. **Monitor Regularly**
   - Check risk status before each trade
   - Review statistics weekly
   - Adjust parameters based on performance

### üìà Using Dynamic Mode Effectively

**When to Enable:**
- Consistently profitable over 20+ trades
- Win rate above required minimum
- Good risk/reward ratio (> 1.5)

**Benefits:**
- Risk capacity grows with profits
- Larger position sizes when winning
- Maintains original risk if account drops

**Example:**
```
Static Mode:
- Start: $10,000, Max DD: $1,000
- After +$500 profit: Still $1,000 max DD
- Risk capacity: $1,000

Dynamic Mode:
- Start: $10,000, Max DD: $1,000  
- After +$500 profit: $1,500 max DD
- Risk capacity: $1,500 (50% increase!)
```

### üîç Reading the Statistics

**Win Rate Interpretation:**
- 60%+ ‚Üí Excellent
- 50-60% ‚Üí Good  
- 40-50% ‚Üí Acceptable (with good R:R)
- <40% ‚Üí Needs improvement

**Risk/Reward Ratio:**
- 3:1+ ‚Üí Excellent
- 2:1+ ‚Üí Good
- 1.5:1+ ‚Üí Acceptable
- <1.5:1 ‚Üí Needs higher win rate

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Ignoring Risk Limits**
   - Don't manually override safety checks
   - Respect the max loss per trade

2. **Setting Unrealistic Parameters**
   - Avoid > 10% loss per trade for beginners
   - Don't set max drawdown > 20% of account

3. **Emotional Trading**
   - Stick to the plan when losing
   - Don't increase risk to "win back" losses

4. **Not Recording All Trades**
   - Record every trade, win or loss
   - Include all fees and slippage
